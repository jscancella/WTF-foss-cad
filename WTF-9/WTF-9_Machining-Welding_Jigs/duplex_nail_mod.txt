WTF-9: Duplex Nail Firing Pin Modification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In order to make the assembly of the WTF-9 variants easier for people without access to machinig equipment, there is
now an option to replace the firing pin that previously had to be machined on a lathe with a modified duplex nail.

	- Refer to pictures in the Images folder of what sort of duplex nails to purchase

- The specification of the duplex nail:
	- 8D 2-1/4" (5.72cm)

- These nails are made of a low carbon content steel, thus, they will not be as long-lasting as a properly machined and hardened
firing pin. Additionally, it may be difficult to truly harden/heat-treat these nails due to the low carbon content, but case hardening
is possible. Refer to online tutorials on case hardening for more information.

	- If choosing to improve the longevity of the duplex nail firing pin by heat treating, it is important to avoid warping the nail
	by keeping it vertical during heating and quenching operations.

	- Also, wear a respirator when heating steel coated with compounds such as yellow zinc/galvanization. This process
	can release harmful if not toxic gasses. 

	- If quenching hot steel in oil, it is highly likely that a flame will flare up upon contact with the oil, so do this in a safe place
	and have some sort of fire suppression nearby. DON'T BURN YOUR SHIT DOWN.

- One user has reported over 800 rounds fired with a NON-HARDENED firing pin, so if hardening is not possible in your circumstance,
you may be fine with skipping this process. When the firing pin begins to mushroom at the tip, simply replace the firing pin with
another modified duplex nail.

- Refer to the technical drawings and pictures on how exactly to shape the duplex nail so it functions in place of a machined firing pin.
